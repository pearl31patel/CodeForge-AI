## 🤖 CodeForge-AI — Overview

This **AI Agent** is an AI coding helper built with **LangGraph**.  
It works like a **small team of developers** — you can give it a request in natural language, and it will turn it into a complete working project, creating each file step by step like real developers do.

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Planner Agent** — Analyzes your request and generates a detailed project plan.  
- **Architect Agent** — Breaks down the plan into specific engineering tasks with explicit context for each file.  
- **Coder Agent** — Implements each task, writes directly into files, and uses available tools like a real developer.
